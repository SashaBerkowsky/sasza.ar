hello! my name is sasha, welcome to my <u>personal website</u>.

if you want to know more about me and my background i strongly encourage you to visit the [about me](/about) section.

the main focus of this site, aside of advertising me as a professional of course, is for me to create my own vision and criteria as a developer by sharing my projects and putting my experiences into words.

i wanted to make each visit different, and since i am really into computer generation as well as constrained randomness (and overengineering) i built a [Conway's Game of Life](google.com) implementation using [rust + wasm](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/game-of-life/implementing.html#infinite-universe) and added it as a banner. that way every time you load a page here it's absolutly unique! :).

at the end of this page there is a large playground for you to interact with it, i also added some commands to make it more interesting:

- `left click`: toggle cell
- `ctrl + left click`: spawn glider
- `shift + left click`: spawn pulsar

if you want to use the action bar inside the banner you can toggle it by hovering you cursor over it and pressing `right click`.

have fun and i hope you enjoy my little corner on the internet!
