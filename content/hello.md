hello! my name is sasha, welcome to my <u>personal website</u>.

if you want to know more about me and my background i strongly encourage you to visit the [about me](/about) section.

the main focus of this site (aside of advertising me as a professional of course) is for me to create my own vision and criteria as a developer by sharing my projects and putting my experiences into words.

i wanted to make each visit unique and i am really into computer generation and restrictive randomness so i made a [Conway's Game of Life](google.com) using [rust + wasm](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/game-of-life/implementing.html#infinite-universe) and added it as a banner so each time you load a page here it will be absolutly unique! :)

at the end of this page there is a large playground for you to interact with it, i also added some commands to make it more interesting:

- `left click`: toogle cell
- `ctrl + left click`: spawn glider
- `shift + left click`: spawn pulsar

also if you want to use the action bar inside the banner you can toggle it by placing your cusor on it and pressing `alt + left click`

have fun and i hope you enjoy my little corner on the internet!
