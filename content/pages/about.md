hi! my name is sasha, i’m a proudly argentine certified systems analyst and computer science student, right now i’m working as a full-stack developer with over four years of experience in software development.

if you see me working on projects (whether backend or frontend), chances are i’m using _javascript_. that said, languages are just a tool for me so i’m constantly trying new ones for fun and for my own personal projects.

lately i’ve been really into _c_, _rust_ and _go_. it’s been especially fun for me getting to learn and compare an older (but still highly relevant) systems programming language like _c_ and see (pun intended) the way that it diverges from its modern counterparts, particularly in terms of sintax and memory management.

even though the job market and my professional background have led me down a fullstack-oriented path, my current intention is to shift toward more technical roles, working with fewer abstraction layers and more low-level design. i’ve also been getting into crypto on the side which has been surprisingly refreshing and fun.

# values

my main aspiration as a professional, and what i believe a programmer should focus on, is solving really complex problems in a creative manner, with a positive impact on my country or on my community. this can be either in the field of science or through projects that i truly believe in and feel passionate about.

i care deeply about understanding how things work beneath the surface. for me, learning isn’t just about acquiring tools, but about building mental models that let me reason confidently about complex systems.

i value environments where curiosity, rigor, and collaboration are encouraged, and where the goal is not just to ship features, but to build systems that are understandable and reliable.

# future

looking ahead, i aim to transition from predominantly full-stack and frontend roles toward work that sits closer to the foundations of computing. i’m particularly interested in backend systems, computer science, and cryptography, and in roles where rigorous thinking, low-level design, and scientific curiosity are essential.

in the longer term, i see myself moving further into scientific work as a researcher, contributing to knowledge-driven institutions such as [conicet](https://www.conicet.gov.ar/) or similar research spaces. my goal is to combine strong theoretical foundations with practical experience to work on hard problems with real-world impact.
