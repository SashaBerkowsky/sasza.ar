hi! my name is sasha, i'm a proudly argentinan certified systems analyst and computer science student, right now i'm working as a full stack developer with over 4 years of experience in software development.

if you see me working on projects (whether backend or frontend), chances are i'm using _javascript_. that said, languages are just a tool for me so i'm constantly trying new ones for fun and for my own personal projects.

lately i've been really into _C_, _rust_ and _go_. it's been especially fun for me getting to learn and compare an older (but still highly relevant) system's programming language like _C_ and see (get it?) the way that it diverges from its modern counterparts, particulary in terms of sintax and memory management.

even though the job market and my professional background have led me down a fullstack-oriented path, my current intention is to shift toward more technical roles, working with fewer abstraction layers and more low level design. i also have been getting into crypto on the side which has been surprisingly refreshing and fun.
