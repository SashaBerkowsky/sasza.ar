WORK IN PROGRESS

even though i've been developing software for 4 years, i started programming on a very early age so i wanted to share my background and the way that my desitions have shaped me to the person that i'm today

if you want to have a more precise and sumarized version you can always check out my [resume](/docs/resume.pdf)

# education

my programming journey started on high school as i assisted (ORT highschool)[], a renowned technical highschool located in buenos aires, argentina. this school is known for its vast orientation program that takes place during the last 3 years of the school cycle.

this orientation program allows the students to choose a particular subject/trade and specialize on it in order to get ahead in the job market right after graduating. it was because of this opportunity that i was able to get a rich and stable fundation about software developement and computer science from the early age of 15.

after graduating highschool i enlisted for an associate's degree in system's analysis also within ORT, that allowed me to also persue music by studying in (manuel de falla...)[] by day and working on my system's analist degree by night while also working remote on my first job as a junior software engineer

when i finally had my associate's degree i still seeked to learn more about computer science but also to get deeper into the fundamentals and the scientific side of it, unraveling all the layers of abstractions that we usually take for granted when working on frontend and really take a look under the hood and understand from where all of this comes from, that was the time that i decided that i wanted to move forward for a bachellor's degree in computer science and that's what i'm studying right now at the (university of buenos aires)[]
