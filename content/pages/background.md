although i’ve been working as a professional software developer for four years, i began programming at a very early age, so to give a complete picture of my background, i’ll need to start a bit further back.

if you want a more precise and summarized version you can always check out my [resume](/docs/resume.pdf)

# education

my programming journey started in high school, where i attended [ORT](https://www.ort.edu.ar/), a renowned technical high school located in Buenos Aires, Argentina. the school is well known for its extensive orientation program, which takes place during the last three years of the academic cycle.

this program allows students to choose a particular subject or trade and specialize in it in order to enter the job market immediately after graduating. thanks to this opportunity, i was able to get a solid and well-rounded foundation in software development and computer science from the age of 15.

after graduating from high school, i enrolled in an [associate’s degree in systems analysis](https://www.ort.edu.ar/carreras-terciarias/analista-sistemas-almagro), also at ORT. this allowed me to pursue music simultaneously by studying at the [Manuel de Falla higher conservatory of music](https://cmfalla-caba.infd.edu.ar/sitio/) during the day, while attending my systems analyst degree at night and working remotely at my first job as a junior software engineer.

after earning my associate’s degree i experienced some mixed feelings professionally. i was deeply curious about the fundamentals of computer science, yet i felt really limited by the layers of abstraction and conveniences that we often take for granted as frontend developers. i felt the need to go beyond—to dig deeper and understand the scientific side of computers and programming. it was around this time that i first encountered [george hotz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hotz), a highly influential figure in my career.

i particularly remember coming across [this video](https://youtu.be/N2bXEUSAiTI?si=uTZkUw5wdpwJGMUN&t=538) and being genuinely amazed by it. he managed to articulate many of my concerns with remarkable clarity. i wanted to do more than translate business requirements into code or work with bloated frameworks i didn’t fully understand. i was looking to apply my creativity to solve difficult and meaningful problems—problems that could have a real impact on my community and the world—while building strong fundamentals that allow me to understand complex systems and approach challenging problems with true freedom and a clear understanding of what’s happening behind the scenes.

this motivation ultimately led me to enroll at the [University of Buenos Aires](https://computacion.dc.uba.ar/) for a bachelor’s degree in computer science (ironically, george would probably hate this). i’m currently studying there and loving every second of it. each day i work to strengthen my theoretical and practical foundations so i can pursue scientific research and continue to expand the body of knowledge in the field.
