the source code for [this site](https://github.com/SashaBerkowsky/sasza.ar) is public.

i always try to the best of my ability to use the right tools for the job — no more and no less.

since the goal of this website is simply to express my ideas through plain text (and maybe an image or two), i found it unnecessary and wasteful to use a powerful and trendy framework like _react_ or _nextjs_. the only javascript running here exists to add a bit of my own personality to the page, as well as to show a small demo of my work.

i used [neovim](https://neovim.io/) to write everything in the project. the content of the site is written in [markdown files](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), generated as plain html by [zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and hosted on [vercel](https://vercel.com/).

the design is largely based on the [terminimal](https://github.com/pawroman/zola-theme-terminimal/) theme by pawroman, with quite a few tweaks and customizations of my own. i also made the banner using <u>rust + wasm</u> and adapted a few bits and pieces to make it work within this project — you can read more about it on the [welcome page](/).

whenever possible, i try to use simple open source tools. this gives me confidence that my software will be more reliable, easier to maintain, and free of unnecessary restrictions in the long run.

no ai was used for coding this website. that said, as my english was a bit rusty i did use ai for spellchecking :).
